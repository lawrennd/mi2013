### Preparation

You need to start ipython notebook on your machine. For the DCS machines
in the Edgar Allen building follow these instructions.

### Starting the Lab

You can have a look at the notebook for this lecture on line [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lawrennd/mi2013/blob/master/MI_Lab_class.ipynb).

Once ipython has started copy and paste the following commands into a
new notebook file.

    import urllib
    urllib.urlretrieve('https://github.com/lawrennd/mi2013/blob/master/MI_Lab_class.ipynb', 'MI_Lab_class.ipynb')

Once you've pasted them in press `Shift-enter` to download the notebook.
If you return to the tab containing the `IPython Dashboard` the lab
class should now be there to download.
