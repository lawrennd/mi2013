### Learning Outcomes Week 6

This lecture covers the following learning outcomes

-   Mapping the basic programming concepts into algorithms for machine
    learning.
    -   Ability to make small modifications to existing code to change
        an algorithm.
-   Be able to relate lines in a programming language to mathematical
    formulae.
    -   Understanding that the mathematical derivations we create can
        map to implementations in code.
    -   Understanding how mathematics is implemented as code, for
        example data structures like arrays can map to mathematical
        structures like vectors.
-   Understanding the particular needs when interacting with data: an
    environment that allows the display of the data. (e.g. IPython
    notebook).
-   Reinforcing the previous lectures' learning outcomes.
