Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms
========================================

### Lecture Notes

This week we continued with the

[updated lecture slides from week 4](./assets/w4_unsupervisedAndProbabilities.pdf), with a particular focus on continuous probability densities, and how they represent distributions, and then an illustration of how maximum likelihood and minimum error are the same for a Gaussian density and least squares error function.
